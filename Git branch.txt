The first default branch is master

What is Branch?

branch allows us to work on differnt versionsn on the same parallel

we can work one multiple braches
which are independent from each other

we can decide to incorporate or marge our changes into other branches



How to implement brach
head pointer point to master branch


to see your defualt branch and head pointer
you can type the following command
git log --all --decorate --online -graph


or else you can create alias
alias graph="git log --all --decorate --online -graph
"


now if you will type only

graph



Now create branch 

git branch SDN
git branch auth
git branch ---to diaplay all branches


work on new branches
initilay head is pointing to the master bracnch but if you will points to the newly created branch 
then,
git checkout SDN
then if you will see 
graph

the check status
git status
